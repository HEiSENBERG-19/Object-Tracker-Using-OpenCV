After running the prediction pipeline for object tracking and uploading the model results to BigQuery, you can configure a [Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio) dashboard to get customized visualizations and point-in-time analysis to gain insight and take action toward waste management.

CircularNet offers a Looker Studio template you can copy to your Google Cloud account to make your own dashboard. The template provides a baseline to adapt to your analytics and reporting needs. Customize your dashboard for case-specific charts and reports based on the model results stored in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction) as the data source.
